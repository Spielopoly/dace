    The tile-op vectorizer emits full-width tile memlets (``x[i, j:j+W]``)
    whose accesses are mask-guarded at runtime. When a tiled dimension starts
    near the array end (e.g. a single-column assignment ``x[:, N-1] = v``),
    memlet propagation unions these to a *provably* out-of-bounds outer subset
    (``x[0:N, 0:N+W-1]``), which SDFG validation rejects (e.g. inside
    ``apply_gpu_transformations()``'s ``simplify()``). Since the mask
    guarantees no element beyond the array end is touched, the declared
    footprint is soundly narrowed to the array domain.

    The clamp is gated: only memlets already marked ``allow_oob`` (by
    :func:`mark_tile_op_memlets_allow_oob`) or whose memlet tree reaches a
    tileops library node — including across NestedSDFG boundaries — are
    narrowed. Any *other* provably-OOB memlet is a genuine bug with no mask
    guarding it: it is left untouched (with a diagnostic ``UserWarning``
    naming the memlet) so downstream validation rejects it loudly instead of
    silently compiling a truncated footprint.

    Both ``subset`` and ``other_subset`` are clamped, each against its own
    endpoint's descriptor (resolved from the memlet path the way
    ``validate_state`` does). After narrowing, ``volume`` is recomputed from
    the new ``subset``.

    Two kinds of edges are never narrowed:

    * Edges incident to library nodes: tile-op expansions require their own
      memlet subsets to match ``widths`` exactly (full-tile write contract).
    * NestedSDFG boundary edges whose connector feeds a tileops node
      (the always-on NestedSDFG body descent): the inner connector array is a
      full ``W``-wide window, so the boundary subset must stay ``W`` wide.
      When provably OOB they are marked ``allow_oob`` instead of clamped.
